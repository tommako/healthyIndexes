    STEP 1
For Men: 1 x body weight (kg) x 24 = _________
For Women: .9 x body weight (kg) x 24 = _________

Men 10 to 14%
Women 14 to 18%	1.0
Men 14 to 20%
Women 18 to 28%	.95
Men 20 to 28%
Women 28 to 38%	.90
Men over 28%
Women over 38%	.85

Example Step 1
1 x 90.9 x 24 = 2182

Example Step 2
2182 x .95 (multiplier from table 1 corresponding to 15% body fat) = 2073

BMR = 2073 calories / day

Note: To determine your average BMR per HOUR, simply do not multiply by 24 in the equations in step 1, or divide the daily BMR by 24. In our m, 2073 divided by 24 = 86.4 calories / hour.

Protein	4 calories per gram
Carbohydrates	4 calories per gram
Fat	9 calories per gram

Carbohydrates	45% to 65%	4 Cal/gm
Protein	10% to 35%	4 Cal/gm
Fat	20% to 35%	9 Cal/gm

Sedentary Adult (RDA)	0.40
Adult Recreational Exerciser	0.75
Adult Competitive Athlete	0.90
Adult Building Muscle Mass	0.90
Dieting Athlete	1.00
Growing Teenage Athlete	1.00

.90 x 200 = 180 grams of protein per day
180 grams x 4 calories per gram = 720 calories from protein

.15 (15%) x 3420 total daily calories = 513 daily fat calories
513 fat calories / 9 calories per gram of fat (see table 2) = 57 fat grams per day


3420 daily cals - 513 fat cals - 720 protein cals = 2187 carbohydrate calories
2187 carbohydrate calories / 4 calories per gram (see table 2) = 547 grams of carbohydrates per day

Fat	15%
Protein	21%
Carbohydrates	64%


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For men: BMR = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (years) + 5
For women: BMR = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x age (years) – 161

1.30 = Very Light: Sitting, studying, talking, little walking or other activities throughout the day
1.55 = Light: Typing, teaching, lab/shop work, some walking throughout the day
1.65 = Moderate: Walking, jogging, gardening type job with activities such as cycling, tennis, dancing, skiing or weight training 1-2 hours per day
1.80 = Heavy: Heavy manual labor such as digging, tree felling, climbing, with activities such as football, soccer or body building 2-4 hours per day
2.00 = Very Heavy: A combination of moderate and heavy activity 8 or more hours per day, plus 2-4 hours of intense training per day
Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) = BMR x Activity Level Multiplier

Protein	4 calories per gram
Carbohydrates	4 calories per gram
Fat	9 calories per gram

Carbohydrates	45% to 65%	  4 Cal/gm
Protein	10% to 35%	          4 Cal/gm
Fat	20% to 35%	              9 Cal/gm
